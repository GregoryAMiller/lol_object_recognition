- TODO:
    - Get map image assets
    - determine if the labeling model is good enough for deployment
    - label all images
    - train model to detect champions/skins
    - get bounding box coordinates -> make images transparent background -> place image at the location of the bounding box on map image
    
    

- DONE:
    - change from PNG images to JPEG (to save space) (Done)
    - finish script to label images (Done)
    - train the model with labeled data (fine-tune yolov8 or another model) (Done)
    - Find a model that can properly label our generated images (did not do, trained our own labeling model)
    - Fine-tune labeling model for labeling our images (done)
