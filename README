Requeriments:
    - Python 3.10.0 was used in creating all files. Any version higher should still work but see bpy (Blender api) requeriments.

Generating YAML File:
    - Under model_collection directory run the file yaml_creation.py (or .ipynb file with the same name)
        - This file will be saved in the model_collection directory which will be needed for collecting models

Collecting 3d Model Assets:
    - Under model_collection directory run the file model_collection.py (or .ipynb file with the same name), make sure to have the .yaml file created and in the same directory as model_collection.py (or .ipynb file with the same name)
        - These 3d models will be saved in the models folder in the parent directory as glb files under the champion name they belong

Generating Images of 3d Assets:
    - Under generate_data directory run the file generate_images.py (or .ipynb file with the same name)


ORDER OF OPERATIONS:
    1 - Collect the models for blender: model_collection folder run model_collection.py
    2 - Generate images using blender: generate_images folder run generate_images.py
    3 - Label the generated images: label_images folder run label_images.py
    4 - Calculate and modify label name to interger: modeling folder run fix_labels.py
    5 - Create yaml file for yolov8 model: modeling folder run create_yaml_file.py
    6 - Split data into train,test,val in yolov8 format: modeling folder run train_test_val_split.py
    7 - Fine-Tune (train) base Yolov8 model with our data: modeling folder run fine_tune_yolov8.py
    8 - View Images of the new model on some test images: modeling folder run model_evaluation.py
